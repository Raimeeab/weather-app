# Weather Dashboard

![weather-dashboard-demo](https://github.com/Raimeeab/weather-dashboard/blob/main/assets/images/weather-dashboard-demo.gif)

## Description 

This project is a weather app that displays the current and future weather conditions, along with current date and time using Weather APIs. I learned the importance of APIs and how they can allow for more meaningful applications in my future projects.

## Technologies used 

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- BootStrap
- Moment JS
- Open Weather APIs

## Usage 

User can search any city in the world and will be presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. The user will see the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The user be presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. When a city in the search history is clicked, the user is then again presented with all the information once more. 

- The UV index is colour coded to indicate whether the conditions are favourable, moderate or severe 
- When a city name has been added to the search history, it will not be duplicated if the user searches the city again
